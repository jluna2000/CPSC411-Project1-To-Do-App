# To Do App

This simple To Do app is made for the CSPC 411A course using Android Studio's Jetpack Compose.

## Concepts Used

This project is used by the following companies:

- Data Class: Data class used to define the properties of a Task in the To Do app
- UI State: State management done through the usage of mutableStateOf and mutableStateListOf
- State Hoisting: Composables in the To Do app, such as TaskBlock, do not have built in functions and instead receive lambda functions from parent

## Demo (2x speed)
